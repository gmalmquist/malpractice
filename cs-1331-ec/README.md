# CS 1331 Extra Credit Homework

This is a homework assignment I wrote as a joke, and sent to a
friend of mine (who happend to be the head teaching assistant for
Georgia Tech's introductory object-oriented programming class).

To my surprise, he actually used it as an extra credit assignment,
that he released on April 1st.
